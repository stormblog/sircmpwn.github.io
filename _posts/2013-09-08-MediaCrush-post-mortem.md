About two months ago, I approached my friend jdiez over IRC with a proposition.

    <SirCmpwn> I'm thinking of making a website for hosting gifs
    <SirCmpwn> but when you upload a gif, it converts it to ogv and renders it with HTML5 video
    <SirCmpwn> faster load time + better quality
    <jdiez> hmmmm
    <jdiez> sounds like a great idea
    <SirCmpwn> I bought gifquick.com
    <SirCmpwn> .net
    <jdiez> not one of your best names
    <SirCmpwn> you're a name
    <jdiez> I have one

After someone suggested a less silly name (and a little programming on the side), [MediaCrush](https://mediacru.sh)
was born. If you missed it, it's a website for hosting media (images, video, audio, vectors). Privacy first,
open-source, lots of [other things](https://blog.mediacru.sh/2013/07/19/MediaCrush-for-nerds.html) the
tech-literate like. This is the first project I've tried to promote properly, and one of my more intersting
collaborations. So here's how it went:

## Hacker News

By far the most succesful way to promote MediaCrush was on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com). I
submitted "[Show HN: An open-source media hosting site that's anonymous and fast](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6189397)",
and got lots of good feedback and generated a lot of excitement. Thanks to those who saw and contributed to
that thread. This one, I think, was a success because the readers of Hacker News almost univerally fall into
our target audience, and they're mostly smart folks who are able to give an informed opinion on the site. They
can also see the benefits of our sort of service compared to the competetion.

Result: Positive

## Casual Conversation

As a project I was invested in and that I think is pretty cool, I naturally started chatting about it around
the web (mostly in IRC). Lots of people liked it, and the MediaCrush IRC channel still has a fair number of
regulars. This had mixed reactions, from apathy to supportiveness. This is harder to remember since these
interactions are buried deep somewhere in my thousands of IRC logs. I don't think it made us many long-term
users, but we got some good feedback.

Result: Positiveish

## /g/

We didn't mean to promote it on /g/, but someone (not related to us) posted about it there and we saw it in
our referers. I dropped by and answered a couple questions. 4chan generally liked it, and was impressed by
the tech. There were rumors of getting support in a popular 4chan browser extension, but I don't know where
that went. Word of mouth is always the best means of promotion, and that seemed to be the case with 4chan.
Can't say we got a lot of actionable feedback from them, though.

Result: Positive

## Reddit

Our attempt at getting the Reddit users involved was basically a complete failure. MediaCrush links are now
banned from Reddit (though the admins said they'd lift the ban a week ago - situation still developing). We
posted about it in a few places and answered lots of questions. Additionally, we made a bot that users could
summon to a thread to rehost media for them (usually good for gifs, since we get
[crazy good results](https://mediacru.sh/demo) when we host gifs). The Reddit admins told us to stop spamming.
Additionally, when we tried to work with some subreddit moderators (like /r/gifs), we were shot down and the
moderation of several subreddits did not want to support MediaCrush.

However, the response from the users was generally positive, both from the
[technically savvy](http://redd.it/1k4v7h) and the
[general public](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k3uro/xbox_one_handy_guide_for_early_adopters/cbl4rrl?context=3).
We also bought a Reddit ad for a hundred bucks (which buys you fairly low exposure). Unfortunately, the ad was
run *after* the domain was banned, which defeated the purpose. You can upvote some ads, and ours got
more upvotes than downvotes, which is unusual for a Reddit ad.

At the end of the day, though, our biggest target userbase is unable to use MediaCrush and I consider that a
crushing defeat for the site.

Result: Failure

## Conclusion

That's about all the promotion we ended up doing. I am afraid that MediaCrush will fail as a result of
hostility from Reddit. Lessons learned;

* Hacker News is still a great resource to get good feedback on cool stuff you're working on.
* Though I wouldn't expect *every* 4chan board to be worth it, we seemed to get a good response from /g/.
* Be *very careful* with Reddit. There's a fine line between showing off something cool you did, and
  spamming. We still aren't sure exactly where that line lies, but we certainly went over it.

The graph at the top of this post says it all. So far, the site has cost me 
[about $750](https://mediacru.sh/transparency/2013-09-01-Financial-summary.md), which is not as bad as it
could have been. I hope to keep it alive for as long as possible. I don't want to let down the users who
have been supportive of us, and I don't want existing media vanishing from the web.

Keep in touch, we'll see how my next big project goes.
