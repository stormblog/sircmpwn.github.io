title: Dealing with Ideas
---

I have a lot of ideas. This is probably why my [GitHub account](https://github.com/SirCmpwn) has so many different
projects in it. However, I often have an idea that I don't feel like working on right that second, and thus the
idea is discarded and forever lost. I have found a solution:

1. Have idea
2. `cd ~/sources`
3. `mkdir idea && cd idea`
4. `vim README.md`

Now, whenever I have a new idea that I think could go somewhere, I think up a name for it on the spot (no reason not to
change it later if the name sucks), give it a directory, and write a README. Jot down all of my ideas and describe
what I want it to be. I do a `git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"` and I'm done!

I might get to these spontaneous ideas at some point, or they might just rot in my sources folder. I'm also thinking
about pushing them to GitHub and letting anyone pick them up. I'd like to know what people think about that idea -
let me know if you'd be interested in a GitHub profile full of unfulfilled ideas, waiting to be finished.

So, in short, write a README for your spontaneous ideas and do the rest later.
