title: Introducing scdoc, a man page generator
---

A man page generator is one of those tools that I've said I would write for a
long time, being displeased with most of the other options. For a while I used
asciidoc, but was never fond of it. There are a few things I want to see in a
man page generator:

1. A syntax which is easy to read and write
2. Small and with minimal dependencies
3. Designed with man pages as a first-class target

All of the existing tools failed some of these criteria.
[asciidoc](http://asciidoc.org/) hits #1, but fails #2 and #3 by being written
in XSLT+Python and targetting man pages as a second-class citizen.
[mdocml](http://mandoc.bsd.lv/) fails #1 (it's not much better than writing raw
roff), and to a lesser extent also fails criteria #2[^1]. Another option,
[ronn](https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn) meets criteria #1 and #3, but it's
written in Ruby and fails #2. All of these are fine for the niches they fill,
but not what I'm looking for. And as for GNU info... ugh.

So, after tolerating less-than-optimal tools for too long, I eventually wrote
the man page generator I'd been promising for years:
[scdoc](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc). In a nutshell, scdoc is a man page
generator that:

- Has an easy to read and write syntax. It's inspired by Markdown, but
  importantly it's not *actually* Markdown, because Markdown is designed for
  HTML and not man pages.
- Is less than 1,000 lines of POSIX.1 C99 code with no dependencies and weighs
  78 KiB statically linked against musl libc.
- Only supports generating man pages. You can post-process the roff output if
  you want it converted to something else (e.g. html).

I recently migrated [sway's manual](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/1958) to
scdoc after adding support for generating tables to it (a feature from asciidoc
that the sway manual took advantage of). This change also removes a blocker to
localizing man pages - something that would have been needlessly difficult to do
with asciidoc. Of course, scdoc has full support for UTF-8.

My goal was to make a man page generator that had no more dependencies than man
itself and would be a no-brainer for projects to use to make their manual more
maintainable. Please give it a try!

[^1]: mdocml is small and has minimal dependencies, but it has *runtime* dependencies - you need it installed to read the man pages it generates. This is Bad.
