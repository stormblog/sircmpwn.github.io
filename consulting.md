My expertise is available for hire.

In consulting I aim to help companies learn not just what the correct design
choices are, but *why* it's so. I help people deliver value with software that
is elegant, consistent, and fast.

I accomplish this with deep experience in all areas of technology. My work goes
as deep as writing device drivers in assembly and as high as building rock-solid
single-page-apps in JavaScript; as serious as large-scale release automation for
mission-critical applications and as unserious as deep OpenGL work for video
games. An understanding of the entire techology ecosystem is extremely effective
for finding effecient and novel solutions to your problems.

Clients work with me because:

1. When it's crunch time they can't afford to iterate on bad designs, and rely
   on me to have the foresight to judge problems and the skill to quickly
   execute on their solutions. They trust me to design systems, write code,
   allocate resources, lead teams, and deliver.
2. They want someone who understands more than their niche. Novel approaches can
   be the edge you need, and those come from people with broad experience to
   draw from. Having worked on software from the top to the bottom, I easily
   pull solutions from across domains to solve problems.
