<p>I am a software developer. In my spare time, I do lots of open source stuff. Occasionally, I will
compose a post for this blog.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>I work on <a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn">a lot</a> of open source software. Here are some interesting projects of
mine that could use your help. I accept pull requests on all of my GitHub repositories, so feel free to contribute to anything
else that interests you.</p>

        <a target="_blank" href="https://mediacru.sh"><h2>MediaCrush</h2></a>
        <p>Need someone to host your video, audio, or images? Want to run your own server for doing the same? I've worked with
        my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jdiezlopez">@jdiezlopez</a> to make a cool site for doing just that. We could use
        help with our enourmous <a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush/issues?state=open">backlog of GitHub issues</a>,
        or <a href="https://mediacru.sh/donate">donations</a> to keep the servers online. Site's written in Python, CoffeeScript,
        and SCSS, so feel free to join in if that's your cup of tea.</p>

        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/KnightOS/kernel"><h2>KnightOS Kernel</h2></a>
        <p>If you have an interest in the low-level world, you'll love this. This is a kernel (and technically a userspace, but
        it's pretty bare) for Texas Instruments calcultors, written entirely in z80 assembly. Working on it is a challenge, but
        it's very fun. It's got a lot of Unix-isms, like a tree-based filesystem, multitasking, and proper memory management.
        There's lots to do and there's an <a href"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=knightos&uio=d4">IRC channel</a> to do
        it in, if you're interested.</p>

    <div class="post-stub">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net"><h2>Craft.Net</h2></a>
        <p>An open-source implementation of Minecraft, written in C#. Includes a client, server, and a bunch of useful libraries
        for doing things like editing levels or simulating worlds. It's functional, but it could use a lot of work getting to
        feature-pairity with the official Minecraft software. If you'd like to help, glance through
        <a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/issues">the backlog</a> or join the
        <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=craft.net&uio=d4">IRC channel</a>. The exciting work is trying to get things
        working for Minecraft 1.7.x, which introduced an entirely new networking stack.</p>
